3. Download all two files
4. Put the two files in the folder created in step 1

How to edit:
> Read this only if you want to customize the chart.
1. Have a text editor (i.e. Notepad++)
2. Open the file "Akuma Aidoru Shinkaron.tja" with the editor
3. Change the character set as follows:
   ```
   (This is based on settings of Notepad++)
   ➤ Encoding
      ➤ Character sets
         ➤ Japanese
            ➤ Shift-JIS
   (After that you should see Rumii's name displaying properly)
   ```
4. Show your creativity!
